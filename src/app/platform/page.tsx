              Developing a medical device — especially software-based solutions — requires strict
              adherence to regulations like FDA 21 CFR 820, ISO 13485, and IEC 62304. SmartEye
              centralises and automates your design control processes, making it easy to manage
              design inputs and outputs, risk management and hazard analysis, design verification
              and validation (V&amp;V), design reviews and approvals, and SDLC documentation.
